There are a lot of 'variables' that may be different between our environments 
(production, development etc...)

A tool called Node Forman can help us handle these issues

Node Forman can do many things but one of these is handling environment variables

once installed we can call

nf.js

We can then use nf instead of node to call our 'scripts' in our package file,
and node foreman will look for an .env file and use the values in here to 'fill' our 
environment specific variables.
