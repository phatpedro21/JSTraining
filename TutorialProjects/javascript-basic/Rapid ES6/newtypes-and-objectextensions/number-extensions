many global functions are now being moved into Objects, so

parseInt, parseFloat etc... all belong to Number


Most have same functionality but some are slightly different


e.g. isNaN and isFinite would try to parse strings into ints first,

    Number.isNaN and Number.isFinite will now return false if passed a string



Number.isInteger() is new,

Number.isSafeInteger is also new and checks if a number can be represented in floating point form without losing precision


New Constants

Number.EPSILON
Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER
