ES6 Has native support for Promises

Passing values to the reject() or resolve() will be passed on to the 'callbacks' called in hten

Returning a value from a promise resolution/rejection is returned as a nother promise to be used in the chain



Promise.all()
-------------

We can pass Promise.all() an array of promises (or code that returns promises) and it will only complete its 
.then  once all promises are completed and resolved. (unless looking for failures, as soon as one fails, it will complete failued
code)

Promise.race()
--------------

Like Promise.all(), but will take the first promise that returns first and handle depending on that result.
