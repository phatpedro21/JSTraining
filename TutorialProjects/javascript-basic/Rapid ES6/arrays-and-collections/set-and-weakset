Sets (and weaksets) are just like Maps(and weakmaps) Except they deal with individual items, not key value pairs
and we use Sets to ensure all items  are unique

Examples

    let perks = new Set();
    //Constructor can also take an iterator

    perks.add("New Car");
    perks.add("Health Insurance");
    //Attempting to add a duplicate will be ignored
    perks.add("New Car") //size will still be 2, because this would be a duplicate and is not added

    console.log(perks.size)     //will print 2


    .has() returns true or false if passed value exists in the Set

    .keys(), .values() will simply return the Set

    .entries() will return the set but duplicated (e.g.  New Car, New Car  Health Insurance, Health Insurance)

    (THE Value is treated as both the key and the value)


BEAR IN MIND THAT TWO Different objects, with the same values will both be allowed to exist, as they are still 'unique' objects



- A WeakSet must contain objects
