Objects can be considered as maps, being key and value pairs, however in an object, we cannot use objects as keys

In Maps (and WeakMap) we can use objects as keys


Only difference between map and weakmap is that if an object referenced in a weakmap is garbage collected, it will automatically
be removed from the weak map.


With a new map created

           let employeeMap = new Map();

    we add values using set()

            let employee1{name:"Alex"}, employee2{name:"Brenda"};

            employeeMap.set(employee1, "AAA");
            employeeMap.set(employee2, "BBB");

    WE CAN ALSO create a map by passing it an iterable 
            e.g.
            let arr = [[employee1, "AAA"] , [employee2, "BBB"]];
            let employeeMap = new Map(arr);            

    and we can retrieve values with get() (passing the key we want)

            employeeMap.get(employee1);  //Will return "AAA";
            employeeMap.size;           //Will return 2 (number of 'pairs' in the map)

    .delete(key) will remove a pair

    .clear() will empty a map

    .has(key) returns true if the key exists

    .values() returns all values only

    .entries() returns all pairs as an array


We cannot check size on a weakmap
