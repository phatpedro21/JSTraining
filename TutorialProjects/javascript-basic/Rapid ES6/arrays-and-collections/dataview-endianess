Big endian most significant bit stored first
Little endian least significant bit stored first

We use the Dataview object to handle endianess

We can create a DataView() by passing it an ArrayBuffer

DataView then gives us some functionality ontop of our ArrayBuffer

such as....

    We dont use [] notation, we set data using functions so.

        To set an unsigned int at position 0 with value 1

        dataview.setUint8(0,1);

    DataViews deal with big endian by default, to tell it to work otherwise we use

        dataview.getUint8(0, true)
        //here its looking for value at position 0, but reading it as little endian as set wby the true
