DEFINING PROPERTIES OF AN OBJECT
-----------------------------------

In ES6 we do not need to repeat a name when defining a property
 e.g. we used to have to do

 var name="Peter", number=23;
 var product{
     name:name,
     number:number
 }

NOW we can shorthand to 

var product{
    name,
    number
    //Can also shorthand define functions like so
    printProduct() {
        console.log(name + " : " + number);
    }
}

-We can also use a string literal as an object name
 And we can also use the [] to use and expression as a property name

var name = "VarName", number=123;

var anObject = {
    "long name with spaces": 45,

    //Will set a property named VarName-123
    [name + "-" + number]: 123,

    //also works for functions
    "function name"(){
        //do thing
    }



}

HOWEVER if these names have spaces they must be accessed using [] also like...

console.log(anObject["long name with spaces"]);
