REST
----------------
'...' defines 'rest'

As a function parameter, the symbol will 'gather' trailing arguments into an array

let restFunc = function(a, index, ...others)
{
    if(index < (others.length-1);
    console.log(others[index]);
}
restFunc(10,3, 30, 46, 100, 53);


If there are no args to put into our 'rest' param, it will be set to an empty array
but the rest parameter will be ignored if checking the 'length' of a function (it will only return)
the number of non rest params

SPREAD
------------------

-Spread is basically the opposite of rest, using the same '...' symbol

-Given an array, list etc... we can split it up into components,

for example

Math.max takes as many args as we wish and returns the biggest
if we have an array on nums,

let numbers = [13,43,56,22,53,12]

//And we want to pass them as args to math.max we use spread, to pull out each individual number
Math.max(...numbers);


-We can also use spread to copy arrays
like so...

let newNumArr = [...numbers];

Missing values using this method will be set to undefined
e.g.
let missingData = Array(...[,,]);

will set missingData to [undefined, undefined]


-Spread can also split a string into individual chars
