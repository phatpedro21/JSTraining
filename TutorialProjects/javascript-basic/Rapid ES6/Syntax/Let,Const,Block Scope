let KEYWORD
------------
while using the var keyword variables will be 'hoisted' (declared and set to undefined at start of scope)

the let keyword stops this functionality, leading to 'variable undefined' errors should a variable be
accessed before its definition

let variables also cannot be redefined 

const KEYWORD
-------------
It's good to define constants with UPPERCASE_NAMES

consts must be initialised when created, otherwise we get an errors

consts cannot be redefined, we will get an error if we try to.

BLOCK SCOPING
-------------
Using curly braces we can define new Block Scopes

for example...

let aVar = 10;
{
    let aVar = 20;
}
console.log(aVar); //Will print 10, as the second declaration is within a now closed scope;
