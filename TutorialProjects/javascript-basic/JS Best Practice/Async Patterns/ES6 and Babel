Before using async - await (coming/added in ES7) we should discuss using babel to allow us 
to write nicer code now, and transpile to other versions

for example, we should use the 

let  keyword, which is a ES6 feature, 

however we may need to operate on ES5 'systems'

so we can use babel to take out code, written well in ES6 and 'transpile it'
into ES5 for use elsewhere

(Same can be done to convert ES7 down to ES6 while it is unsupported)
