StrictMode STOPS javascript to stop 'helping' where it thinks it needs to help.
(i.e. by creating variables at global scope if we forget to define them properly in our
function scopes (see Global Variables.txt))

To 'use' strict mode we simply put the following line at the top of a script

'use strict'

We will then get errors for situations that SHOULD break, as javascript is no longer 
'trying to help'

We don't have to call 'use strict'in the global scope, we can call it in 
any scope, by calling the line as the first line in that scope. E.g. we can force strict mode
only within a new function we are developing, rather than in the entire global scope.
