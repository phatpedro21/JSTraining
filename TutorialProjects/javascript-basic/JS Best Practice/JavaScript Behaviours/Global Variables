If we forget to prefix a new variable creation line with 'var'

e.g. 

newVar = 12;

instead of 

var newVar = 12;


Javascript will 'step up' scope to find it, and if the global scope doesn't 
find it, it will create one for us (like it sometimes automatically inserts semicolons).
This will lead to some unexpected behaviours, such as variables we expect to be 
'encapsulated' actually being globally accessible.
