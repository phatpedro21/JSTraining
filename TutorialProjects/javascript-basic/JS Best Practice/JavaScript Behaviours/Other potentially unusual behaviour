DUPES
--------
If we were t oaccidentally define a 'parameter' more than once, e.g.

function myFunc(a,b,c,a){
    console.log(a);
}

Javascript will simply treat the last 'dupe' as the value e.g.

myFunc(10,20,30,40)

would print 40.

To show an error in this case, we need to use strictmode.

THE delete KEYWORD AND DELETING PROPERTIES
-------------------------------------------
The delete keyword will only delete PROPERTIES on an object.

Attempting to delete an entire object will fail gracefully (continue without deleting)
or throw an error in strictmode.
