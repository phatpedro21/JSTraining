In JavaScript, numbers starting with a 0 are assumed to be OCTAL
(We might start numbers with 0 otherwise to line up code e.g.

    x = 120
    y = 014

)

In the above example, x+y would be 132 not 134 (as 014 in octal is 12)

0x defines hexadecimal

HOWEVER, if we turn strictmode on, starting a number with 0 will throw an 
error, not assume to be octal, in this case we should use 

parseInt(number, base(8 for octal));
