the with keyword (used to make accessing nested variables easier) is considered
depreciated and should not be used 

(Example use

    var obj = {
        a:{
            b:{
                c:"Hello
            }
        }
    }
    with(obj.a.b){
        console.log(c);
    }
)
This had a number of issues arising around uncertainty of what a varible was pointing at
in circumstances, so is advised to not be used

SO to access nested variables in a better way we can use IIFE'like so
(function(Object){
    console.log(newVar)
}(obj.a.b.c))
