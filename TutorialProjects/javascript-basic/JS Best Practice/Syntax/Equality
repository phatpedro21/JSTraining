When comparing two objects, there are two comparison operators

'=='  and  '==='

'=='
Will compare the value of two objects. It will try to convert
objects to be the same type and then compare
e.g. 

4 == '4' is true
0 == false is true


'==='
Will compare 'EXACTLY' will not convert type, if they are different automatically false,
else it'll check if they are same

4 === '4' is false



--------------------------------------------------

if(x) is short hand for  if(x == true)

so using if(x) to check for existence may have unexpected outcomes.

e.g.

//X not defined
if(x){} //Will error

x = 0;
if(x)   //Will be false


It is better to check...

if(typeof x !== "undefined");
