When creating a new Node project first thing we should do it call

npm init 


This will set up our package.json file.


PACKAGE.JSON
-------------

Within out package.json file we should thing about the following

--the engine keyword--

    //Here is an example of setting up for a node 4.2.1 engine
    "engines":{
        "node":"4.2.1"
    }

    The engines keyword tells the project what 'version' of an engine
    it should run for. so that if our package is 'out of date' npm install 
    will raise an error


--npm save by default--
    To avoid having to add --save to npm install lines (to update the package.json)
    we should call the following lines

    npm config set save=true


--stop dependencies using the ^
    When dependencies are added to package.json, the may have the '^' in their
    version meaning "this version or similar" (allowing minor changes to be acceptable)

    However, this could lead to issues, to ensure we only ever get a tried and tested 
    version of dependencies we can use the following lines

    npm config set save-exact=true

    (And then we can simply install newer versions when we have tested them)
