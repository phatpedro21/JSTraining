One cross platform consideration is that

On Mac and Windows,  

a file called 

myObject.js and myobject.js are considered the same

However, on linux this is not the case.

With this in mind, files should be named in lowercase, with '-' inbetween words
to ensure our code is truly crossplatform 

--e.g. 

    my-object.js 

    ^ This is the suggested way to name files
