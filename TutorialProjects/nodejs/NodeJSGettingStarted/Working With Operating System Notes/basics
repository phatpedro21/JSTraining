there are a few built in modules in Node to help up work with the operating system

e.g.

os                  -enables communication with the Operating System

fs                  -reading and writing to the OS

child_process       -Enables us to run any OS command directly from within Node


OS
----
see os-examples.js

FS
----
Enables interation with the filesystem
Allows us to work with buffers, streams


CHILD_PROCESS
-------------
Allows us to execute any OS command within Node by creating and using a subprocess and then
using the result of that process in our main process

key methods

        spawn()   <- Reccomended to use this 
        exec()
        execFile()

        fork()  <- This one creates new Node processes, and ties in with the clusters idea
