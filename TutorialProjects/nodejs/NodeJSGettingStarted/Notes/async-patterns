Node has very heavily used the 'callback' pattern for a long time, although it 
is starting to pick up new patterns as they become available.


Node implements an 'error first callback pattern' in which callback functions (the last argument to any ansync method)
expect an error object first, and then data.

If an error is encountered this is passed as the first argument, else the first argument will be null


Node has started to adapt promises however, making for neater, cleaner code that avoids the pitfalls of 
callbacks.

    util 
module, provides a method allowing us to 
    promisify
