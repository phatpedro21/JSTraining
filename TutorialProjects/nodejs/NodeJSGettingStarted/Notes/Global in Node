In Node, there is a Global object, which is accessible via 

    global.


Many things we do such as 
    setTImeout()
are simply shorthand for
    global.setTimeout()

global is the only 'concept' of global in node.

While it is not advised, we can add to or change global values like follows
e.g.

    global.petesGlobal = 101;

and these can be accessed by

    petesGlobal

BUT REMEMBER, DO NOT CREATE OR CHANGE GLOBAL VARIABLES!
