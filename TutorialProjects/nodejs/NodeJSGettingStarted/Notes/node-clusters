Keeping in mind that unknown errors should be allowed to continue and 'crash out',
we might wonder how this will be acceptable in production.


Generally, in production we will have many instances of node running in a node cluster

We should generally be running a node cluster no matter what our set up as even with a single 
instance/process in a cluster the Master will be keeping an eye out on what is happening
and can restart node after a crash, monitor the issue etc. et...

We can make use of clusters using...

-Node Cluster module
-Tools like PM2 which wrap the cluster module
