The Event Loop is what Node uses to process asynchronous actions and
interface them for you so that we don't have to deal with threads


The event loop will continue to run aslong as it needs to, if Node can 
see that it no longer needs to continue processing (reach end of operation)
it will exit the loop and close the process.
