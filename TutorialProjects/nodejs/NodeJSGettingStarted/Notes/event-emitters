The events library is a very important built in aspect of Node, and many other modules 
implement event emitters


Emitters can 

    .emit(string)           -This will emit a string, which will be a name used to identify and event


    .on(string, callback)   -This will tell an emitter to evoke the callback, everytime the event represented
                             by the string is fired

                            -this can be called multiple times, allowing us to attach many functionalities to a single event
