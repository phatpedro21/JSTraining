Node has a built in debugger, although it is not the most powerful,

it does however link in very well with chrome developer tools



run a code with 

    node --inspect 
or
    node --inspect-brk      (brk here means break, so not expectign to run anything yet)


If we then go to url

        chrome://inspect

We should see our node process and will be able to inspect it with chromes poweful dev tools
