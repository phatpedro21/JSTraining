EJS Uses the following syntax


Generally, html is exactly the same as you'd expect.

To insert JS we use 

<% %> Tags

An '=' sign will simply 'return' the following value

To perform plain javascript, we exclude the '=' 

We can wrap html with jsfor example to loop through a list

<% for(let is=0; i<list.length; i++) %>

    <li> <% =list[i] %>

//Close our for loop after
<% } %>


TO use embedded formatting in output we use a '-'

<%- %>
