node -h will give a list of options (pipe to more for easier reading)

some of these options such as --v8-options will reveal options for
other systems, such as v8 in this case


Node -h ALSO lists environment variables for node.
-notably 

NODE_DEBUG will force modules to outpur extra debugging info if they are cinfigured to do some
NODE_PATH contains list of directories for the module search path

Use these flags before node in a node call e.g.
NODE_DEBUG node 'fileToRun'

We can also pass other environment vars to a node session e.g.
VAR1=10 STRING1="DOG" node 'fileToRun'

These can then be accessed via process.env.VAR1 etc...
(This also how we access default env variables such as USER)

can also pass args to a call (like with most sh commands)
e.g. node 'script' 1 "dog" 
this will create a (STRING) array ["1","dog"]
which can be accessed with process.argv in the script
