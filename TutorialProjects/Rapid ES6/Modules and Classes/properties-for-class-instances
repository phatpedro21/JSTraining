STATIC MEMBERS
--------------
ES6 Introduces the static keyword

static methods are attached directly to the class.

This means that they MUST be called on the class, and cannot be called on instances.


To create static parameters, we can simply assign a variable to a class (static keyword doesn't work for this)
e.g.

    class Thing{

    }
    Thing.staticVar = 10;
