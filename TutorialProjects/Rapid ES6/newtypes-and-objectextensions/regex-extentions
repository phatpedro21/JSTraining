Define regex patterns with '/ /'



To work with the new \n{} functionality and 'more than 4 char' unicode, we need to suffix with 'u'

so  pattern = /\u{1f3c4}/u WILL WORK
              /\u{1f3c4}/  WILL NOT WORK

(For unicode chars with more than 4 chars, that are seen as 2 characters by javascript we also need to use the unicode
 suffix to allow them to be considered '1' character by the regex)


 a y suffix will tell our regex to look from a 'lastIndex' which we can set
